# Nexus Installation Script

This script automates the installation process of Nexus Repository Manager on a newly provisioned Ubuntu server on AWS. Nexus Repository Manager is a popular tool used for managing software artifacts and dependencies.

## Minimum System Requirements

To ensure optimal performance, it is recommended to use a minimum instance type of `t2.large` or `t3.large` when installing Nexus. These instance types provide sufficient resources for running Nexus and its associated services.

## Installation Steps

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Setting Hostname**: The script sets the hostname of the EC2 instance to "nexus" to identify it as the Nexus server.

2. **Updating Packages**: The script updates and upgrades the system packages to ensure that the server has the latest security patches and updates.

3. **Creating User 'nexus'**: It creates a user named 'nexus' with sudo access to manage Nexus services.

4. **Installing Java**: The script installs OpenJDK 8, which is required for running Nexus.

5. **Downloading and Extracting Nexus**: Nexus Repository Manager version 3.65.0-02 is downloaded and extracted to the `/opt` directory.

6. **Configuring Ownership**: The ownership of Nexus and Sonatype-work directories is changed to the 'nexus' user to ensure proper permissions.

7. **Configuring Nexus Run-As User**: Nexus is configured to run as the 'nexus' user for security reasons.

8. **Creating Systemd Service**: A systemd service file is created to manage the Nexus service, specifying its startup and shutdown commands.

9. **Reloading Systemd Daemon**: The systemd daemon is reloaded to apply the changes made to the service configuration.

10. **Starting and Enabling Nexus**: Finally, the Nexus service is started and enabled to ensure that it automatically starts on system boot.

## Usage

### Option 1: Direct Execution

To use this script, simply copy and paste it into a new file on your Ubuntu server and name it nexus-install.sh. Execute it using the bash interpreter:

### Option 2: Clone from GitHub

Alternatively, you can clone the repository containing the script onto your server using the following command: 

    git clone https://github.com/kwbna-ababi/sonatype-nexus-installation-script/

Navigate to the cloned repository directory and execute the script:

    cd sonatype-nexus-installation-script
    sudo bash nexus-install.sh
